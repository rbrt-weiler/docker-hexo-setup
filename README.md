# docker-hexo-setup

This is [my](https://robert.weiler.one/) personal setup for a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image that is used to develop a website using the [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) static site generator. A prebuilt image is available as `rbrtweiler/hexo-setup:latest` from Docker Hub.

See the included [HOWTO](HOWTO.md) for details on building and using the Docker image.
